## First time users
If you are unfamiliar with ROS and intend to use the ROS API, it is highly recommended that you read the [ROS Tutorials](http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials).

If you are unfamiliar with the terminal on Linux, you should look [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/183775/how-do-i-open-a-terminal).

Shadow software is deployed using Docker. Docker is a container framework where each container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything needed to run it. It is similar to a virtual machine but with much less overhead. Follow the instructions in the next section to get the latest Docker container of the hand driver and interface up and running.

## Hardware specifications

In order to run our software and the ROS software stack you will need to meet some hardware requirements. 

CPU: Intel i5 or above
RAM: 4GB or above
Hard Drive: Fast HDD or SSD (Laptop HDD are very slow)
Graphics Card: Nvidia GPU (optional)
LAN: A spare LAN port to connect the Hand (even with a USB to LAN adaptor)
OS: Ubuntu 18.04, 16.04 Kinetic (Active development) or 14.04 Indigo for older releases.

The most important one is to have a fast HDD or an SSD.

## Docker
### Installing the software on a new PC using the one-liner
We have created a one-liner that is able to install Docker, download the image and create a new container for you. It will also create two desktop icons, one to start the container and launch the hand and another one to save the log files locally. To use it, you first need to have a PC with Ubuntu installed on it (preferable version 16.04) then follow these steps:

#### Installing for a real robot 

* **Check your hand interface ID**: 

  Before setting up the docker container, the EtherCAT interface ID for the hand needs to be discovered. In order to do so, after plugging the hand’s ethernet cable into your machine and powering it up, please run

  ```bash
  $ sudo dmesg
  ```
  command in the console. At the bottom, there will be information similar to the one below:
   
  ```bash
  [490.757853] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): enp0s25: link becomes ready
  ```
  In the above example, ‘enp0s25’ is the interface ID that is needed.

* **Get ROS Upload login credentials**

  If you want to upload technical logged data (ROS logs, backtraces, crash dumps etc.) to our server and notify the Shadow's software team to investigate your bug then you need to enable logs uploading in the one-liner. In order to use this option you need to obtain a unique upload key by emailing sysadmin@shadowrobot.com. When you receive the key you can use it when running the one-liner installation tool. To enable the logs uploading you need to add the command line option ```-ck true``` to the one-liner.
  After executing the one-liner, it will prompt you to enter your upload key and press enter to continue. Please copy and paste your key from the email you received by Shadow Robot.

* **Check your hand configuration branch**:

  You should have the name of your [sr_config](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr-config) hand branch which contains the specific configuration of your hand (calibration, controller tuning etc…).
  Usually it is something like this: ``shadowrobot_XXXXX``. 

  If you are unsure please contact us. 

* **Run the one-liner**:

  The one-liner will install Docker, pull the image from Docker Hub, and create and run a container with the parameters specified. In order to use it, use the following command:

  **Please remember to replace [EtherCAT interface ID] with your Interface ID and [sr_config_branch] with your unique sr_config branch**

  ROS Kinetic (Recommended):
  ```bash
  $ bash <(curl -Ls http://bit.do/launch-sh) -i shadowrobot/dexterous-hand:kinetic-release -n dexterous-hand -sn Hand_Launcher -e [EtherCAT interface ID] -b [sr_config_branch]
  ```
  Examples:
  For Interface ID ```ens0s25``` and sr_config_branch ```shadow_12345```
  ```bash
  $ bash <(curl -Ls http://bit.do/launch-sh) -i shadowrobot/dexterous-hand:kinetic-release -n dexterous-hand -sn Hand_Launcher -e ens0s25 -b shadow_12345
  ```  
  Same as above but with ROS logs upload enabled
  ```bash
  $ bash <(curl -Ls http://bit.do/launch-sh) -i shadowrobot/dexterous-hand:kinetic-release -n dexterous-hand -sn Hand_Launcher -e ens0s25 -b shadow_12345 -ck true
  ```  

  ROS Indigo:
  ```bash
  $ bash <(curl -Ls http://bit.do/launch-sh) -i shadowrobot/dexterous-hand:indigo-release -n dexterous-hand -sn Hand_Launcher -e [EtherCAT interface ID] -b [sr_config_branch]
  ```
  Examples:
  For Interface ID ```ens0s25``` and sr_config_branch ```shadow_12345```
  ```bash
  $ bash <(curl -Ls http://bit.do/launch-sh) -i shadowrobot/dexterous-hand:indigo-release -n dexterous-hand -sn Hand_Launcher -e ens0s25 -b shadow_12345
  ```  
  Same as above but with ROS logs upload enabled
  ```bash
  $ bash <(curl -Ls http://bit.do/launch-sh) -i shadowrobot/dexterous-hand:indigo-release -n dexterous-hand -sn Hand_Launcher -e ens0s25 -b shadow_12345 -ck true
  ```  

  You can also add -r true in case you want to reinstall the docker image and container. When it finishes it will show:
  ```bash
  Operation completed
  ```
  and it will create two desktop icons on your desktop that you can double-click to launch the hand or save the log files from the active containers to your desktop.
  The icon that launches the hand looks like this:

  ![desktop_icon](../img/desktop_icon.png)
   
  And for saving the logs:

  ![log_icon](../img/log_icon.png)

#### Installing for using it in simulation

If you do not actually have a real hand but would like to use our hand in simulation, then please run the following command:

ROS Kinetic (Recommended):
```bash
$ bash <(curl -Ls http://bit.do/launch-sh) -i shadowrobot/dexterous-hand:kinetic-release -n dexterous-hand -sn Hand_Launcher -b kinetic_devel -l false
```

ROS Indigo:
```bash
$ bash <(curl -Ls http://bit.do/launch-sh) -i shadowrobot/dexterous-hand:indigo-release -n dexterous-hand -sn Hand_Launcher -b kinetic_devel -l false
```

You can also add -r true in case you want to reinstall the docker image and container. When it finishes it will show:

```bash
Operation completed
```
and it will create two desktop icons on your desktop that you can double-click to launch the hand or save the log files from the active containers to your desktop.

### Using a PC that Shadow provided
In this case, the previous steps would have been performed by the Shadow team before, then the only thing to do to start the Hand is to either double-click the desktop icon or to run the container using:

```bash
$ docker start dexterous-hand
```

You can check the currently available containers using:
```bash
$ docker ps -a
```

The container will be ready when fingers move to the zero position. 

## Saving log files and uploading data to our server
When running the one-liner, along with the icon that starts the Grasper, you will also notice a second icon named Save logs that is used to retrieve and copy all the available logs files from the active containers locally on your Desktop. This icon will create a folder that matches the active container's name and the next level will include the date and timestamp it was executed. When it starts, it will prompt you if you want to continue, as by pressing yes it will close all active containers. If typed 'y' to continue, you will have to enter a description of the logging event and will start coping the bag files, logs and configuration files from the container and then exit. Otherwise, the window will close and no further action will happen. If you provided an upload key with the one-liner installation then the script will also upload your LOGS in compressed format to our server and notify the Shadow's software team about the upload. This will allow the team to fully investigate your issue and provide support where needed. 

## Starting the driver (Real hand)

* **Shadow Hand Driver**
  Launch the driver for the Shadow Hand using the desktop icon 'Hand_Launcher' or at a
  terminal (in the container), type:

  ```bash
  $ sudo -s
  roslaunch sr_edc_launch sr_edc.launch
  ```

  **Warning**: This terminal now has root privileges, and the system is giving you
  permission to do things which can mess up the configuration of the PC. Do not run any
  other commands in this terminal window. Only use this terminal to launch the driver.

* **Lights in the hand**:
  When the ROS driver is running you should see the following lights on the Palm:

  ```eval_rst
  ========================   =============       ================    =================================
  Light                      Colour              Activity            Meaning
  ========================   =============       ================    =================================
  Run                        Green               On                  Hand is in Operational state
  CAN1/2 Transmit            Blue                V.fast flicker      Demand values are being sent to the motors
  CAN1/2 Receive             Blue                V.fast flicker      Motors are sending sensor data
  Joint sensor chip select   Yellow              On                  Sensors being sampled
  ========================   =============       ================    =================================
  ```

  After killing the driver, the lights will be in a new state:
  ```eval_rst
  ========================   =============       ================    =================================
  Light                      Colour              Activity            Meaning
  ========================   =============       ================    =================================
  Run                        Green               Blinking            Hand is in Pre-Operational state
  CAN1/2 Transmit            Blue                Off                 No messages transmitted on CAN 1/2
  CAN1/2 Receive             Blue                Off                 No messages received on CAN 1/2
  Joint sensor chip select   Yellow              Off                 Sensors not being sampled
  ========================   =============       ================    =================================
  ```
